The Wizard of Oz slots game, developed by WMS Gaming, is a popular online slot that offers an exciting and nostalgic experience for fans of the classic movie. To get the most out of your gameplay, it's essential to understand how paylines and payouts work in this slot machine. This guide will help you navigate these key aspects of the game and improve your chances of winning.

## What Are Paylines?

Paylines are the lines on which a payout will be awarded based on winning combinations. In the Wizard of Oz slots, there are 30 available paylines, and players can choose how many to activate during each spin. The more paylines you activate, the higher your chances of landing a winning combination, but this also increases your total bet per spin.

### How Paylines Work

1. **Adjacent Reels**: Winning combinations must occur on adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel.
2. **Bet Distribution**: Your total bet is divided equally among all active paylines. For example, if you bet $1 with 10 active paylines, each line will receive a $0.10 bet.
3. **Highest Win**: Only the highest win per payline is paid out, but wins on multiple paylines are added together to form your total payout.

## Understanding Payouts

Payouts in the Wizard of Oz slots depend on the symbols that land on the paylines and the amount you bet. The game features a variety of symbols, each with different payout values.

### Key Symbols and Their Values

- **High-Value Symbols**: Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion offer higher payouts.
- **Low-Value Symbols**: The Wicked Witch, the Tornado, and other thematic items yield smaller payouts.
- **Wild Symbol**: The Wizard of Oz game logo acts as the wild symbol, substituting for all other symbols except for special feature symbols.
- **Feature Symbols**: These trigger bonus rounds and special features like free spins and additional payouts.

### Bonus Features and Their Payouts

The Wizard of Oz slots are rich with bonus features that can significantly boost your winnings:

1. **Oz Pick Feature**: Activated by three feature symbols, this bonus allows you to choose from three options, potentially awarding cash prizes or triggering other bonus rounds.
2. **Winged Monkey Feature**: This free spins round is triggered by the Oz Pick feature, providing opportunities for additional wins with wild symbols.
3. **Road to Emerald City**: An interactive game where you pick emeralds to reveal cash prizes or advance to other rewarding rounds.

## Betting Strategies

To maximize your winnings in the Wizard of Oz slots, consider these betting strategies:

- **Activate More Paylines**: While it increases your total bet, activating more paylines enhances your chances of landing winning combinations.
- **Adjust Your Bet Size**: Find a balance between your bet size and the number of paylines. Betting the maximum on all paylines can yield significant rewards but requires a larger bankroll.
- **Utilize Bonus Rounds**: Take full advantage of bonus rounds and features, as they offer higher payout potential and additional free spins.

# Understanding the Basics

## Game Layout
The game consists of a 5-reel slot machine with various symbols representing characters and items from the Wizard of Oz. Players win by matching symbols in specific patterns across active paylines.

## Symbols and Icons
- **Wild Card**: Dorothy often serves as the wild card, substituting for any symbol to form winning combinations.
- **Bonus Icons**: These include free spins and other bonuses that can significantly boost your winnings.
- **Framed Characters**: Characters with frames offer higher rewards compared to regular symbols.
- **Item Icons**: These are the least valuable but can still contribute to your total winnings when combined effectively.

# Tips and Tricks for Beginners

## Manage Your Bankroll
Set a budget before you start playing and stick to it. This will help you avoid overspending and extend your gameplay.

## Take Advantage of Free Spins
Free spins can significantly boost your winnings without costing you additional credits. Always aim to trigger these bonuses whenever possible.

## Know When to Quit
It's essential to recognize when to take a break, especially after a series of losses. This helps prevent frustration and allows you to return with a fresh mindset.

Different stages offer varying difficulty levels and rewards. For example, the Yellow Brick Road stage provides more frequent but smaller wins, while Munchkinland offers larger but less frequent rewards. Switching stages can refresh your experience and potentially improve your chances of winning.
